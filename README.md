Purpose
-------

The Sharing Cart is a block that enables sharing of Moodle content
(resources, activities) between multiple courses on your site.
You can share among teachers or among your own courses.
It copies and moves single course items without user data
-- similar to the "Import" function in Course Administration.
Items can be collected and saved on the Sharing Cart indefinitely,
serving as a library of frequently used course items available for duplication.


Requirements
------------

Moodle 2.3.1 or later, with AJAX enabled
